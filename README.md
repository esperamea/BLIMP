## Introduction

The BLIMP (Blimp-Like Image and Metadata Package) format is a simple, bitmap-based font file format designed for ease of use and simplicity. It is intended for applications where traditional vector font formats like TrueType (TTF) are unnecessarily complex or resource-intensive. BLIMP provides a straightforward way to store bitmap fonts starting with the full ASCII character set and supports the inclusion of additional Unicode characters as needed.
